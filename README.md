# Elixir Accessories Website
Elixir Accessories is a fully responsive website designed to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience across all devices. The front-end leverages the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing interface with smooth navigation and interactive elements. The back-end, developed using PHP and MySQL, handles dynamic content, user interactions, and efficient data management. This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, showcasing my ability to design, develop, and deploy functional and user-friendly web solutions. With a focus on responsive design, the website adapts effortlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability for all users.
